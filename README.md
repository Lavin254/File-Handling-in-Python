# **File Handling in Python**

This project demonstrates how to handle files efficiently in Python, including reading from and writing to files, as well as gracefully managing errors using exception handling.

## **Features**

- **File Read & Write Challenge**:  
  Reads the content of a file, modifies it (e.g., converts to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file.
- **Error Handling Lab**:  
  Prompts the user to enter a filename and gracefully handles errors like missing or inaccessible files.

## **Files**

1. **`file_read_write.py`**:  
   A script that reads the content of **`input.txt`**, modifies it, and writes the modified content to **`output.txt`**.
2. **`error_handling_lab.py`**:  
   A script that prompts the user for a filename, tries to read the file, and handles errors if the file doesn't exist or can't be accessed.

## **Usage**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Place the input file (`input.txt`) in the same directory for **`file_read_write.py`**.

### **How to Run**

#### **1. File Read & Write Challenge**

```bash
python file_read_write.py
```
